# Headache-Prediction-Model
This project uses an XGBoost classifier to predict the type of headache a person may experience based on simulated headache history data. 

The Model predicts Headache types such as: 
- Migraine 
- Tension 
- Cluster 
- Other 

Using Features such as: 
- Sleep hours  
- Pain location  
- Pain type  
- Trigger type  
- (and other simulated features)

Goals & Learnings

This project helped me:
- Explore practical ML tools like **XGBoost**
- Understand evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Gain hands-on experience with data preprocessing and modeling
- Set a baseline for more advanced health-focused ML projects

Future Improvements

- Improve accuracy with real-world data
- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Explore ensemble models or deep learning
